Whether you're going on a trip for 1 month or 1 year, getting good digital nomad travel insurance should be a priority before setting out on the road.

While disasters can't always be avoided - they can be prepared for in a financial sense.  Getting set up with a reliable and trustworthy company is key when choosing your travel insurance.

Before I tell you what's available here are what you should be looking for when trying to decide...

**Features**

-   Can you submit claims while traveling?
-   Can you use it with international doctors?
-   What's the claim procedure like?
-   Is your gear covered? (laptop, camera, phone, etc.)
-   Can you renew your plan or is there a maximum time limit?

### Well Respected: [Allianz](https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com/)

If you search Google for 'Digital Nomad Travel Insurance' you'll almost certainly see ads for Allianz.  And why not?  They're one of the top insurance companies in the world.  Which also means you'll get some pretty good rates for even mid-sized trips (1-3 months).  However where Allianz falls short for me are the true digital nomad wants.  For example, the maximum coverage on gear is much lower than other plans as well as their flexibility to submit claims or extend coverage while still on the road.

Nonetheless,  if you're just looking for digital nomad travel insurance for a quick trip where you don't expect anything to happen - Allianz can be a great inexpensive option.  Things I'd consider if best for are trip cancellation, lost baggage, or unforeseen illnesses.

### Good Option for EU & UK: [TrueTraveller](https://www.truetraveller.com/)

True Traveller is a great option for adding those digital nomad wants for a travel insurance package like flexibility, higher maximums for gear, and coverage for extreme sports.

The only caveat - well you'll have to be from the EU or UK to pick up a package from them.

### Pay-As-You-Go & Great Value: [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/a/traveldeveloper)

Often times, Digital Nomads don't know how long you're traveling for or where you're headed next.  It can be hard to drop $300-$500+ on travel insurance when you may only need it for a couple months.

That's where [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/a/traveldeveloper) excels...

**​\$37/ 4 Weeks** (\*Ages 18 - 39. $250 deductible. $250k maximum limit. \$69 for travel in the USA. [Other ages available](https://www.safetywing.com/faq.html#how-much-does-it-cost).)

Yes. You read that correctly.  **_\$37 for 4 weeks!_**

This doesn't cover electronic devices or many adventure sports (don't worry surfing **IS INCLUDED!**), but the main reason you're usually buying travel insurance is for medical emergencies.  And for that reason - [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/a/traveldeveloper) is probably the top choice for Digital Nomads looking specifically for travel health insurance.

Some of the other key features I love about [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/a/traveldeveloper) for digital nomad travel insurance are...

**Extremely flexible** - Choose your start-date and it automatically extends until you cancel, unless you choose an end-date (like a subscription). There is no cap on the duration of a travel.

**Covers you abroad and home** - [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/a/traveldeveloper) has worldwide coverage and limited home country coverage. It is available for purchase in 180 countries and can be purchased when already traveling.

Not many travel insurance companies can compete with this Y-Combinator backed company.  And that's why Safety Wing is one of my top choices for digital nomad travel insurance.
