description: The pandemic is probably going to spurt growth in hundreds of thousands of developers building their own projects - here's my list.

Back in October of 2019, I had set out to start a personal project building hiatus...

**1 project / month**

**For 6 months**

...then I got hired by a baby food company that wanted 20-30 hours a week,

...on top of a few other freelancing jobs.

It was _doable_ - but yeah - only if I wanted to **hate my f\*cking life**.

And that's just what happened...

I over-booked myself and became completely **_burnt out_**.

Which partly led me to [decide to quit freelancing](/work-independently).

The one thing that was a bonus of over packing my schedule was the opportunity to create a stockpile of cash ðŸ¤‘

..._pretty lucky considering the pandemic_...

With about 30K saved up, and having been granted an 'indefinite' emergency visa in [Bali](https://www.google.com/maps/search/bali?hl=en&source=opensearch), I don't think there's been a **better time** to get back to building...

I'll have about 1-2K expenses per month, so as long as I don't have to throw a wrench in the plans for travel, getting robbed, or health concerns - I should have plenty of runway for **6 months** and in time to head back to the US for the holidays, weddings, and a break in December.

So here's the plan for the projects through the rest of 2020...

-   **APRIL:** [Animali](https://animali.life) (animal conservation web app)
-   **MAY:** SurfScreen Store (shopify), Nana Recipe app (flutter), [#startsmall](https://startsmall.llc)
-   **JUNE:** [UPPE](https://uppe.org) (internet UN)
-   **JULY:** Open Company (buffer style dashboard of revenue, salaries, etc. sharing)
-   **AUGUST:** NPO Finance (more 'local-inclusive' app for funding projects)
-   **SEPTEMBER:** Stack (what are the top things people use)
-   **OCTOBER:** Barter (marketplace for exchanging services and goods)
-   **NOVEMBER:** Medical history (personal health app)
-   **DECEMBER:** [Animali](https://animali.life) (mobile app)

It won't be a small feat - but _f\*ck_ will I learn a lot when I get through it all.

I plan on sticking to some of my favorite, current technologies - and trying not to learn too many new things as I want to build and not get caught in [tutorial hell](https://letslearnabout.net/blog/how-to-escape-from-tutorial-hell-and-never-come-back/').

-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
-   [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)
-   [Vuetify](http://vuetifyjs.com/)
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

I've also packed the schedule with a **reading list**, a daily **morning routine** of breathing and language exercises and a few other things I'd like to learn.

I have a lot of extra energy and hours due to surfing being banned at the moment - so I do expect some less time once that is lifted.

But in the meantime, let the games begin...

_**Frothing mate...**_
