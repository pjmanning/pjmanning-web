Would you like to earn some extra money working from home? You should have a look at these great **part time remote jobs** anyone can do.

### My personal story: I was a part-time employee

Let me tell you a bit about myself. After graduating from college - where I studied Business Administration, Computer Science, and Philosophy - I went back to my hometown in New Jersey to figured out what I wanted to do.

I knew I wanted to continue studying programming and web development, so I didn't really want to get a full-time job. **I ended up working various part time side gigs** - like as a barista during the day and a bartender at night.

I later started my own freelance development business, and that's what I've been doing for the past 5 years. But when I look back at the time when I was working part-time jobs, I always regret one thing: **I wish I started working with a remote part-time job sooner than later.**

That's why I decided to start the [Complete Travel Developer Course](https://www.traveldeveloper.com/) and help others that were in the same situation I was in. If you're trying to earn some extra money with a part-time job, **I came up with a list of the best remote part-time jobs you can do from home.**

### What you'll need before you get your first part time remote job

All the jobs on the list have one thing in common: **you can either have a fixed position at a company or you can be a freelancer.**

Of course, every one of these jobs will require certain skills. The key to being able to get a job that allows you to work from home is being great at it. So **make sure to train and get lots of practice** that before trying to get your first job.

But what about experience? Although having experience would help you get your first part-time remote job, it's not mandatory. Modern companies are outsourcing activities to reduce costs and improve efficiency, which is why it's so easy to find a remote part-time job, even for someone without experience.

So what will you need to get your first part-time remote job? **A computer with high-speed internet, a perfected set of skills, and a killer portfolio.**

That's right! Although employers won't care if you have experience or not, you will be asked to show your skills. That's why you'll need a great portfolio and a kick-ass resumé.

### Best remote part time jobs you can do from home

#### Graphic Designer

Graphic design is a very popular freelancing career. Every business wants to invest in improving their image, and graphic design is a huge part of it. And all you'll need is a laptop and a spark of creativity.

Well, that's not all. You should also master Photoshop, Illustrator, and CorelDraw. This will take time. The best way to do it to take as many online courses as you can, read books, and try to learn as you go.

But if you want to start designing right away, there are two great apps that let you do it: [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) and [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/pro/).

#### Creative Writer

Working as a writer can be tough at first, but once you get your first clients and start building a strong portfolio, you'll be alright.

A writer's work can go from writing blog posts and books to creating copy for advertisements. And the best part is you don't need to study much to be good at it.

All you need to become a freelance writer is a creative mind and the ability to write interesting and informative content. If you want to become an amazing writer, you should read blogs and journals and write your own texts on [Launchora](https://www.launchora.com/).

#### Marketing Specialist

If you like advertising but writing long texts isn't right for you, maybe you should try become a marketing specialist.

Your job as a marketing specialist can go from optimizing websites for search engines (SEO) to planning marketing campaigns. Basically, you'll be in charge of driving more web traffic to your clients.

Every marketing specialist needs to learn the techniques of outbound and inbound marketing. If this is your preferred remote part-time job, you should visit [HubSpot Academy](https://academy.hubspot.com/).

#### Bookkeeper

This is a tricky one. Most traditional companies want to have their bookkeeping done by a full-time professional accountant. They won't hire a part-time employee with no experience.

However, many startups and small businesses will. Bookkeeping isn't a difficult task, but it takes a lot of time. That's why smaller companies who can't afford a full-time accountant usually outsource it.

If you don't know what a bookkeeper does, it basically helps employers with their payrolls, accounts, monthly reports, or closing at the end of the year.

All you need to work as a bookkeeper is a basic understanding of accounting and economics - one college course will do. Also, you should master bookkeeping tools like Microsoft Office and [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/).

#### Data Entry

What if you have no knowledge of economics but still want to work with spreadsheets and numbers?

In that case, you could try data entry. It's quite shocking, but many companies need data of all sorts - names, numbers, addresses, and more - to be entered into computers constantly. That's what a data entry freelancers do.

If you think you're fast and accurate while typing, you could try your luck at data entry. But first, make sure to take a typing speed test at [Goodtyping](https://www.goodtyping.com/).

#### Web Developer

**Web development is by far the best job to do part-time from home**. It is one of the most in-demand careers, which means **businesses give their developers a lot of flexibility. Plus, the pay is really good**.

The hard part of being a web developer is becoming one. You need to learn several programming languages and dominate the skills necessary to design websites that stand out.

If you're not sure whether web development is the right job for you, visit [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for a very basic introduction to programming, or **become a pro by taking the** [Complete Travel Developer Course](https://www.traveldeveloper.com/).
