If you haven't thought about how to make money online you're either...

**A)** 90 years old and your grandchild just got you your first computer,

or

**B)** uhhh honestly, I don't know what the hell you're doing.

**_...It's 2018!_** And over [\$1.2 million a year is made every 30 seconds](http://www.adweek.com/digital/real-time-ecommerce/)...in e-commerce alone!

But if you're here and reading this article I don't need to tell you all the statistics. You already know [college isn't worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KNncIXdt6w) and you want to learn how to make money online.

We've all seen the countless plots, gimmicks, articles, and suggestions on what you can do to make money online - but I'm not going to add most of those jobs in here.  No survey taking, or video watching - only legitimate jobs you can do from your computer...

### 38 Jobs How to Make Money Online

#### 38. Network Marketing (MLM)

Ugh do I have to?  Yeah, ok, there are some ways to make money online with [multilevel marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multi-level-marketing.asp) (MLM) schemes.  The thing is - it's just seems like a scheezy plan to try to sell to friends and family who then sell to their friends and family.  However, because some of the businesses become so big there are plenty of success stories.

#### 37. Medical Billing

[Medical billing is the act of communicating with third party payers what services were provided to patients, and why.](http://www.medicalbillingandcodingu.org/what-it-takes-to-get-a-job-in-medical-billing/)  While not the sexiest nomadic job - it gets the bills paid.  There aren't any specific education requirements for medical billing, but you will have to be trained in specific medical coding lingo.

#### 36. Amazon Mechanical Turk

[Amazon's Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) is merely a step above those survey-taking, video watching scams.  Well mostly because it's run by the most legitimate company in the world - [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2AXeqsB).  You get paid very small (usually around \$0.06-0.08) per task for very mundane tasks.  If you have a ton of time on your hands you could make some money.  But don't expect to be living large in the 1st world off this income.

#### 36. Account Manager

Nearly every substantial company in the world needs [account managers](https://www.mediabistro.com/climb-the-ladder/skills-expertise/what-does-an-account-manager-do/) to be the intermediary between the client and the company.  While this position may have you back in the 9 to 5 grind...there's a chance you can do this from anywhere.

#### 35. Create and Sell eBooks

While eBooks may not generate the most income - the barrier to entry is _extremely_ low.  In order to make money online with eBooks, all you need is an expertise in a certain area and a high volume of traffic to a website.  If any particular eBook becomes super popular you can always add more products or services on that topic.

#### 34. Tax Preparer/Accountant

Naturally when you think of an accountant you think of sitting at a desk, in a cubicle, calculator in pocket, 9-5, etc.  Well, accountant's nowadays are bending the mold.  If you get a solid base of clients under your belt you can take your [tax preparation](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/around-block/become-tax-preparer/) skills remote.

#### 33. Buy & Sell Domains

Back in the 1990's [buying and selling domains](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=102768), would've been in the top 10 on how to make money online.  But it's much harder today.  Most big keyword domains have been purchased and the number of domain endings (.com, .co, .us, etc.) has increased to allow for various options.

#### 32. Virtual Assistant

The [virtual assistant](https://www.theworkathomewoman.com/virtual-assistant/) position has grown ever since [Tim Ferris' 4-Hour Work Week](https://amzn.to/2itbk7V).  The premise - hire someone monthly to handle all of your daily mundane tasks...scheduling, research, email correspondence, data entry, etc.  If you land a good client you could make good money online; however, be prepared to be at the whim of your boss.

#### 31. Translator

Translator's are more [necessary in the workplace](https://realwaystoearnmoneyonline.com/money-earning-directory/translation/) than you may realize.  Legal documents, medical documents, online classes, etc.  If you speak more than one language at a high-level - being a translator is an easy way how to make money online.

#### 30. Brand Ambassador

Usually [brand ambassadors](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/280021) are located within a city or college, but some brands have begun to allow brand ambassadors to focus solely on online ambassad-ing (sp? word? idk).  Anyway, if you're good with social media and really connect with a particular brand this could be a great option for you.

#### 29. Blogger

The infamous [blogger](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-be-a-successful-blogger/) position.  Of course the blogger has been on the list of ways on how to make money online since the beginning of [RSS feeds](https://www.lifewire.com/rss-101-3482781).  However, most full-time bloggers still bring in less than \$19k per year.  Not too great of a statistic.  But if you're really keen about a niche topic - go for it.  I did ;)

#### 28. Podcaster

The new age of blogging is audio blogging a.k.a. [starting a podcast](https://www.thepodcasthost.com/planning/how-to-start-a-podcast/).  Usually podcasts earn money online from gaining sponsorships for each 'pod'...or 'cast'...I'm not really sure what the slang for podcasts are to be honest.  Gain enough listeners and you could charge a pretty penny for those sponsorship slots.

#### 27. Customer Service/Admin Support

Many companies have begun to realize customer service and admin jobs can be handled by outside resources and therefore save the company a LOT of money. While you may not earn the same amount of money if you worked in an office, a [customer service position](https://www.upwork.com/o/jobs/browse/skill/customer-service/?sort=renew_time_int%2Bdesc&user_location_match=1) is an excellence stable way how to make money online.

#### 26. Transcriptionist

If you haven't heard of a [transcriptionist](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/work-from-home-job-transcriptionist/) as a job position - don't worry - neither did I .  Basically it's just someone who types out the transcription of audio files.  Turns out it's actually a really great way how to make money online.

#### 25. Online Tutor

Teaching online classes is always a sure shot way to make money online.  If you're bilingual - one of the services I suggest to use is [Verbling](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=736250&u=1363853&m=57224&urllink=&afftrack=).  It's extremely easy to set up an account and you can start earning really good money immediately.

#### 24. Lead Generation

Lead generation is fairly new to the world of making money online.  You'll need some basic web development skills to set up and bring in leads online - then you sell local businesses those leads.  You make money online, the business makes money, and the client gets their service #everybodywins.

#### 23. Rent Out Your Stuff

Have a car, house, clothes, sports gear, etc?  Yep - you can rent out all these things to make money online.  Check out [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [RentNotBuy](http://rentnotbuy.com/), [Loanables](https://www.loanables.com/), [Turo](https://turo.com/), [Spinlister](https://www.spinlister.com/).

#### 22.  Affiliate Marketing

If you can get enough traffic online whether it be from a blog or a landing page on a specific topic - affiliate marketing is a great option how to make money online.  All you do is use special links referring traffic to a particular service/product and get a percentage of the sale. [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2itbk7V) has one of the biggest and [best affiliate programs](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/).

#### 21. Create a Marketplace

If you think you're a good judge of market trends - you can create a marketplace in a specific niche.  A marketplace is somewhere where many different businesses sell their products or services.  It will take some initial setup costs, like getting a website up - but you can quickly and [cheaply set up a Wordpress marketplace](https://themeforest.net/?ref=pmanning11) in a couple of weeks.

#### 20.  Crowdfunding Consultant

Crowdfunding became one of the hottest trends of the past decade.  Nearly every startup wanted to kick off their business with a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) or [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/en) campaign but didn't know where to start.  That's where crowdfunding consultants come in.  Prove you can get businesses a certain amount of money and you can start charging hefty bills.

#### 19.  Graphic Designer

One of my favorite websites and services is [99designs](https://ninetyninedesigns.7eer.net/c/582851/185967/3172).  And some of the best independent designers exist on [99designs](https://ninetyninedesigns.7eer.net/c/582851/185967/3172).  You sign up for a free account and create designs on projects to try and win the company's project.  Graphic design does take a lot of time, but if it's something you love doing - you won't mind putting in the extra hours doing something you're passionate about.

#### 17. Content Creator

The adage of the 21st century seems to be "content is king". And companies are willing to pay up to get the best [content creators](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/5-habits-of-highly-successful-content-creators-list) out there.  If you have a knack for creating stunning infographics or short videos - being a content creator is an amazing way how to make money online.

#### 16.  Day Trader

Whether it be through the stock market or cryptocurrency, [day trading](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/day-trading-risks/) can be a very lucrative job.  However, this position isn't for the faint of heart.  Be prepared to lose a lot of money, be glued to financial news, and be stressed out 24/7...well that is unless you win big ;)

#### 15. Video Producer

Video production is something few people know how to do and many people are willing to pay for.  It's not uncommon for a video producer to have an hourly salary around \$150.  Most often the biggest obstacle to video production is finding clients.  Some good ways to keep business coming in is to do smaller jobs on marketplaces like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) and [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/).

#### 14. Facebook/Google Ads Consultant

Facebook and Google are ranked #1 and #2 as the most visited websites on the internet.  This is why they are the two biggest advertising giants in all of the world.  While many businesses know the facts - they have **ZERO** idea how to effectively market themselves on both platforms.  Make money online for your clients and you'll learn how to make some yourself.

#### 13.  Photographer

Learning how to make money online from photography is not easy - but if you can figure it out you'll surely enjoy an incredible lifestyle.  Use a service like [SmugMug](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=523334&u=1363853&m=49765&urllink=&afftrack=) to easily sell your photos and earn money online.

#### 12.  Researcher

If content is king - then research is queen.  Most infographics, blog posts, and business decisions are made on research done by someone behind the scenes. [Being a researcher](http://work.chron.com/become-professional-researcher-17760.html) won't be the most lucrative career, but it will be stable, low stress, and a stable way to make money online.

#### 11. Social Media Influencer

Do you have a knack for the latest social media?  If you think you have what it takes to be viral on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/), [Musical.ly](https://musical.ly/), etc. then you'll know how to make money online.  Well - really the money will come to you the hardest part is [becoming an influencer](https://marketingland.com/step-step-guide-becoming-influencer-industry-142696).

#### 10. Create a Product (Amazon, Shopify, Etsy)

Every 30 seconds, over \$1.2 million dollars is made on e-commerce.  If you want to get in the game of the fastest growing industry in the US you can create your own product.  You can then sell your product on a marketplace like [AmazonFBA](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm/ref=asus_fba_fnav) or create your own store on [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) or [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/).

#### 9. Business Consultant

Growing up you usually think every business owner knows what he/she is doing.  Well let me tell you a secret - [most business owners have no idea how to run a business](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-roberge/i-finally-understand-why-_b_10734126.html).  They're simply getting by selling their product or service.  The owners that realize they know nothing about business look for consultants who can help them [create larger profits](https://www.financestrategists.com/terms/profit/).  And because more and more businesses are being run online - that means more opportunity for you to make money online.

#### 8.  Freelance Writer/Editor

#8 phheeww.  This took awhile to get to.  And a lot of hours.  And that's why freelance writing is in extremely high demand.  Blogs need content - every. single. day.  And business owners simply don't have the time to research, plan, and post a new article everyday.  If you have a skill with words - you can easily start off making money at around $15/hr as a freelance writer.  The bigger companies you score deals with - those rates can go up to $100/hr...for writing :)

#### 7. Sell Online Courses

One way I've personally made money online is through selling my online course - [The Complete Travel Developer Course](https://www.traveldeveloper.com/).  While the initial investment includes extremely laborious hours, after your course is complete - all you have to do is market it efficiently.  Now this can be harder than you may think, but with services like [Teachable](https://teachable.com/) and [ConvertKit](https://mbsy.co/convertkit/24826355) it's never been easier to make money online with online courses.

#### 6.  UX Designer

In the past few years, demand for UX designers has skyrocketed.  As people's attention span with online content became shorter and shorter, businesses came to realize how important design was to capture a user and not lose them.  You can [learn UX design](https://generalassemb.ly/education/user-experience-design-immersive) fairly quickly and it's a great way how to make money online.

#### 5.  App Developer

If you're a night owl and love to nerd out hard - then becoming an app developer should be your route on how to make money online.  Most app developer's start out at about $75/hr and it isn't uncommon to be in the $150/hr range.  Because supply of good developers is so slim, businesses are chomping at the bit to find [top quality developers](http://toptal.com/).

#### 4.  SEO Consultant

If 2010 was the year you realized you need a website - then 2020 will surely be the year you realize you need SEO services.  As it's become easier by the minute to [create websites](https://www.traveldeveloper.com/), the only way for your website to stand out from the crowd is understanding search engine optimization.  One of the best courses I've found to go from 0 to 60 in SEO is the [ClickMinded SEO Course](https://traveldeveloper--clickminded.thrivecart.com/seo-individuals/) - taught by a SEO manager from [PayPal](https://paypal.com/) and [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/).

#### 3.  Social Media Marketer

So there's 2 options if you're a business owner to get word out about your business.  1 - Create a website and use search engine optimization to rank high on Google or 2 - Create profiles on social media to boost your brand.  You'll likely have to have both, but with so many things to do as a business owner - you'll rarely find someone who wants to spend time with their [social media accounts](https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/attachment/annual-growth-in-social-media-2017-stats/).  This means monthly fees and a great way how to make money online.

#### 2.  Web Developer

Today there is simply no option for not having a website if you're a small business.  This is the reason being a web developer is easily the best way to make money online.

#### 1. Full-Stack Freelancer

Most workers choose to make money online from only one skill set.  As a full-stack freelancer, you'll be able to keep clients in a **lifetime** cycle of services. This is why I suggest you learn **Design**, **Development**, **SEO**, **Social Media Marketing**, and **Business Consultancy**.  You don't need to be a professional in all of these categories - you only need to know enough to get the job done.  And to get to an intermediate level in all of these skills takes no more than 1 month!

Instead of grabbing a client for a simple design value of $1,000 you're able to easily make over $5,000 per project _and_ keep monthly recurring revenue coming in.  There are hundreds of thousands of businesses that need all of these skills - if you can provide them you'll have a very successful online money making machine.
