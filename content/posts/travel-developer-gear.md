One of the key elements to successfully living the Digital Nomad lifestyle is keeping every aspect of your **lifeÂ organized**. Financially, work-wise, logistically, and last but definitely not leastâ€Šâ€”â€ŠtheÂ **gear**Â you physically travel with!

There are just as many **MUST NOT**â€™s asÂ **MUST**Â brings, so think about what youÂ *ABSOLUTELY NEED*Â before packing. If it isnâ€™t aÂ **need**Â and you can pick it up in another countryâ€Šâ€”â€Š**leave it behind**. Below Iâ€™ve listed and provided links to all of the key things I travel withâ€¦

\*Note: some things completely depend on your lifestyleâ€Šâ€”â€Šfor example a surfboard isÂ **required**Â in my life ;)

### Organization

[Tortuga Backpackâ€Š](http://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpack)â€”â€ŠThis thing is the boooomb. Made of waterproof sailcloth itâ€™s a perfect DN backpack. A little pricey but well worth it.

[Bellroy Travel Walletâ€Š](https://amzn.to/2lvaHgh)â€”â€ŠIf youâ€™re on the move youâ€™ll have to have your passport with you regularly. I despised having 2 â€˜walletsâ€™â€Šâ€”â€Šone for cards and money and another little pouch for my passport, airline tickets, etc. This bad boy is a little big but solves that problem.

### Clothing

[1 dress shirt](https://woolandprince.com/collections/button-down-shirts) for going out to a respectable placeâ€Šâ€”â€ŠMerino wool is my go-to. Light, wrinkle-free, BO-free.

[1 pair of nice jeans/khakis](https://amzn.to/2l229ut)

[1 lightweight jacket](https://amzn.to/2pQfMSI)â€Šâ€”â€Šcold, wet, etc. this will become your best mate. Pick one as lightweight as possibleâ€¦unless youâ€™re going to Alaska duhhh.
