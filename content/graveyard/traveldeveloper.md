description: Probably my first 'successful' business.  I really put a LOT into this online course before online courses were really a thing.  Taught design, dev etc. Learned so much from video production to customer service to promotion to public speaking. In the end, I chose to list the site on a discount provider and there was no coming back $2 profit per course is not sustainable.  Would've been better to continue to create extreme value and charge a premium for less students - however most of my students were on a budget.
