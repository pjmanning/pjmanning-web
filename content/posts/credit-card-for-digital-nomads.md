### What's the best **credit card for digital nomads**?

Our favorite choice is the [Chase Sapphire Reserve](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/19/6HIFVYKBPG).

Why?

Well just check out these benefits...

- 3x Points for Travel Related Purchases
- $300 Annual Travel Credit
- Complimentary Airport Lounge Access (my favorite ðŸ˜‰
- Global Entry or TSA PreÂ® Fee Credit ($100 value)
- Special Car Rental Privileges
- Trip Cancellation / Trip Interruption Insurance
- Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver
- No Foreign Transaction Fees
- Baggage Delay Insurance
- Trip Delay Reimbursement
- Roadside Assistance
- Lost Luggage Reimbursement
- Travel and Emergency Assistance
- Travel Accident Insurance
- Emergency Evacuation & Transportation
- Emergency Medical and Dental Benefit

Now there is a $450 annual fee...but really this is only $150 after your $300 worth of travel credits.  

These credits are deducted automatically for anything related to travel.

For example, if you get an Uber (even in your hometown), this will be reimbursed up to your yearly $300 fee.  So there's no reason you shouldn't be using the $300 worth of travel credit throughout the year.

Add that with the free Global Entry fee and tons of other perks and I'd say it's totally worth it.

By far my favorite perk is the free airport lounge access to over 1000+ lounges across the globe.  Basically this makes travelling become a luxury rather than a hassle ðŸ˜‰  I now look forward to going to the airport early to get some complimentary drinks and do some work in a nice lounge space before taking off on my flight to my next destination.
