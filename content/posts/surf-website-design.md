Founded in 2013, doodDevelopments was built to provide quality web development experiences to surf related businesses at an affordable price. After viewing small businesses go bankrupt from larger design firms charging tens of thousands of dollars to create a website, the founders decided to help these smaller players compete online without breaking the bank.

Websites offer the best form of marketing and with responsive design it is more affordable than ever to offer websites and mobile websites to potential customers for a very low cost.
