Are you looking for a short-term backpacker job or a position that would allow you to live in a certain country for a long time? This is just one of the questions you need to ask yourself before becoming a real backpacker.

### Start Talking to People and Budget Wisely

One of the best ways to find out if there are jobs available for backpackers is by word of mouth. Find other backpackers in the city and start talking to them about jobs for remote workers.

You can also look for work online and check out some of the most popular websites for backpackers seeking work like [http://www.jobaroo.com/jobs-for-backpackers](http://www.jobaroo.com/jobs-for-backpackers) or [https://www.backpackerjobboard.com.au/](https://www.backpackerjobboard.com.au/).

It is very important to budget wisely and have enough money to live in a new city before actually finding a backpacker job. This will give you an opportunity to search for a job without having to worry about money.

### Which Backpacker Job is Best For You?

The good news is that there are many positions available for you to decide which backpacker job is best fitting to your lifestyle. We’ve rounded up a list of the best jobs for people who are interested in working remotely.

### Short-Term Jobs

#### 1. Working in a Hostel

There are many hostels around the world where you can find work. Some of these places run their businesses off the books and you can work there in exchange for free accommodation and tips, while others are looking for backpackers who are searching for full shifts and long-term jobs.

Expect to find hostels where you will clean rooms, work at the reception, or pour drinks at the hostel bar. The pay is usually not that great, but most of the places in the accommodation industry offer a place to stay for backpackers who are looking for work.

There are two ways to find a job in a hostel. You can either send your resume to a bunch of hostels before the trip, or simply go from place to place and see who is interested in hiring a remote worker.

#### 2. Work on a Farm

Many digital nomads will tell you that working on a farm is one of the best ways to travel as a backpacker. Farm work usually ranges from picking fruits and planting trees to taking care of animals.

Most of these jobs are usually seasonal, which makes them appealing to backpackers who wish to move around a lot. Accommodation and food are in most cases included in your paycheck, so you won’t have to worry about overspending on meals and a place to stay.

#### 3. WWOOF Jobs for Backpackers

WWOOFing means working for someone in exchange for accommodation and food. In most cases, you will need to work only 4 hours per day. There are many WWOOF jobs for backpackers to choose from including working on organic farms, wood chopping, gardening, etc.

Keep in mind that you will need to obtain a WWOOFing organization membership for a small fee, but that’s an investment that will allow you to live like a local, have lots of free time on your hands, and save cash on both food and accommodation.

#### 4. Bar and Restaurant Jobs

There are many bars and restaurants that are looking for people who will work for them, especially during the tourist season. It’s a great chance for remote workers who want to earn some extra cash while traveling around the world.

Beware that many of these places will ask for you to stay for a few months, as they need to have additional workers during the season. The best thing about working as a backpacker in restaurants and bars is that you will get to visit some cool touristy cities and meet new people.

#### 5. Work as a Nanny Abroad

Accommodation, food, and extra cash! This backpacker job is one of the best out there. You will be in charge of babysitting the kids, taking them to soccer practice, and going grocery shopping in some cases. Some families will even provide you with a car, so you can move around more easily.

Of course, getting along with kids is a must when it comes to working as a nanny abroad. The truth is that this job is usually reserved for female travelers or couples. The peak season for a job as a nanny is usually during the school holidays when kids are at home and parents need to be at work.

### Long-Term Jobs

#### 1. Freelance Jobs

In case you are not planning to move around a lot, working as a freelancer is one of the best ways to earn money as a backpacker. Basically, all you need is a laptop and a proper Internet connection to be able to work as a freelancer.

There are many freelance jobs available online. You can work as a freelance graphic/web designer, writer, programmer, etc. Check out some of the best online platforms for freelance jobs including [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/), [PeoplePerHour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/), [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/), [99 Designs](https://99designs.com/), [Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/), etc.  One of the best things about working as a freelance backpacker is that you don’t have a boss and you can arrange your working hours as you wish.

#### 2. Teaching English

One of the most popular remote jobs for backpackers is teaching English. For example, there are thousands of young people moving to countries such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand and teaching English in pre-schools. Some of the institutions will ask you for a TEFL qualification, while others simply do interviews with candidates and don’t require any special papers.

Of course, there are backpackers and digital nomads who prefer to give private English lessons. You can also work online, as there are many agencies around the world who hire backpackers to teach English online.

### Countless Opportunities

The truth is that the opportunities for getting a backpacker job are endless. The most profitable long-term solution is to work as a freelancer, while seasonal jobs are the best way to earn cash in just a couple of months and then move to another city and look for more work.
