Times up - I'm choosing to **work independently** now.

I started to freelance back in 2013 when I first learned to code. It was the allure of freedom, travel, and being my own boss - you know everything you read in the [4 Hour Work Week](https://amzn.to/2VTeO6n) that made it seem like the dream lifestyle.

And for many years it _really_ was the **dream**...

> I had a unique path you can [read about on my website Travel Developer](https://www.traveldeveloper.com/phil-manning-digital-nomad/).

For the past 7 years, I've worked and lived throughout Central America, Bali, Australia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Morocco, South Africa, France, Portugal, and probably a few other places I'm forgetting.

I'm actually currently writing this from a perfect little villa, steps from the beach in Bali.

For most people my lifestyle is _ideal_.

And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it...

...it's just...

It's time to tell my clients to go f\*ck themselves ðŸ–•

Yeah.

I'm over it.

Maybe it's the realization from the coronavirus pandemic that 95%+ of the world is working on absolutely pointless things, or a bit of introspection after my grandma passed away...

...I'm completely done working on projects I don't agree with whether it be morally/financially/time allocation/etc.

It's put me into a **0-BS** mode where if I'm hearing buzzwords thrown around by people that don't know shit, and seeing others put on the fake '_busywork_' routine, to sound _busy_ rather than actually being efficient and getting shit done...

...I absolutely _cannot_ deal.

Maybe this was a long time coming...

Some of the other things that turned me off were the more obvious...

-   No health insurance
-   Clients demanding immediate work / then severing ties at their discretion
-   Constant dealing with contracts to try to avoid getting screwed
-   Delayed payments
-   Things I could've gotten done in a day take weeks or a month of back and forth bs
-   Getting content - _seriously_ over asking for 1 line of text for weeks

I've saved up a bit of ðŸ’° and I'm ready to work independently.

To build pet projects that I believe in or just have an itch that needs to be scratched.

It's been a great learning experience but it's time to use my skills to do independent work and see if I can really build the things in my imagination.

I anticipate I may need some money so I've decided to ween myself off over the course of the next month and set a high rate for any and all work requests. For example...

-   `Starting June 1`
-   `$250/hr for design, dev, SEO`
-   `$500/hr for consulting`
-   `Contracts with a minimum of $2500/week`

It's bold and on the high end for me - but I'm really trying to deter people unless I'm making enough money to outsource dev on my projects.

For the next 6-7 months - I'll be working on my own projects...1 per month (will be outlined in a new post to come next week).

I think the choice to work independently also stemmed from having a great client the past 6 months.

The hours were long at times, and my boss was a nightmare - but they paid great and consistently while allowing me to work remote.

If more companies go remote - which it seems like COVID-19 is accelerating - then the need to be a freelancer to work remotely is going to diminish.

And that's probably for the better...
