**Bali** needs more than just our prayers right now‚Ä¶

As the entire world deals with the implications of COVID-19, the effects have **different consequences** for different parts of the world.

For much of the world living on less than a dollar per day - there is **no safety net**‚Ä¶

Currently, I‚Äôm on the east coast of Bali in a town called **Keramas** - well-known for it‚Äôs world-class wave that‚Äôs been featured on the [World Championship Tour](https://www.worldsurfleague.com/).

Outside of its surf allure - Keramas and the surrounding villages are where some expats still see flickers of ‚Äòthe Bali of old‚Äô - before the island became a premier tourist destination.

Walk the beaches here and you‚Äôll still find only local warungs (restaurants), fishermen, and kids running by waving and screaming _'halo!'_

For those of you that have been to Bali before - **you know the magic** - the majestic cliffs and volcanoes, picture perfect beaches, cheap massages, world-class restaurants, and nightlife second to none.

Most first-timers who visit are so wowed by Bali‚Äôs idyllic excellence that they‚Äôre ready to **spend a lifetime**. And those lucky enough to spend enough time in Bali truly know where that excellence comes from‚Ä¶

The magic of the _‚ÄòIsland of the Gods‚Äô_ undoubtedly comes from **the Balinese people**.

There are few spots on this planet where the community is so warm and welcoming with open arms that so many people from all walks of life instantly **feel at home**.

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have traveled to many places around the world and know the endless amounts of beautiful beaches, cheap meals, and good waves that exist...

What makes any place _truly_ special are the people that inhabit it.

The Balinese have the warmest **smiles**, the most genuine **care** for other people, and a common **presence** that many around the world pay money trying to attain.

Right now - it‚Äôs these same beautiful people that **need our help**.

The vast majority of us who've been so lucky to visit the island, probably haven‚Äôt ever known what it means to go hungry. Skipping meals, maybe for a couple of days, living in a hut without proper running water, or a place to cook food.

While this existed even before the pandemic, right now things have gotten far worse‚Ä¶

### WHAT‚ÄôS GOING ON?

-   [80% of the island‚Äôs GDP comes from tourism](https://www.9news.com.au/world/bali-economy-collapsing-with-no-tourists-allowed-on-island-because-of-covid-19/37df5ab2-86a7-4f4e-bbd9-10eda8f45911) with nearly the entire population indirectly dependent on tourism income
-   Bali closed to new tourists since mid-March - only a few tourists left on the island
-   No safety net
-   No stimulus, with little to no government support
-   Pre-pandemic [average monthly salary below \$300](https://balistoreluggage.com/blog/umk-bali-ump-indonesia/)
-   Most people living paycheck to paycheck with little to no savings
-   No end in sight to tourism restrictions (likely many more months)

I‚Äôm helping a local foundation in Keramas ([Legong Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/legongfoundation/)) deliver packages of necessary food to the people most in need.

One package includes‚Ä¶

-   5kg rice
-   30 eggs
-   1 liter of oil
-   5 packages of noodles

This entire package can feed a family of 4 for about 5 days.

**It costs 110,000 Rp or \$8 USD**

### HOW CAN YOU HELP?

#### 1. Donate

[Donate here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/east-bali-coronavirus-fund)

Your donation can be life-changing for a family in need.

For the price of 1 low-end meal in the US, you can provide food for a hungry family of 4 ‚Ä¶ for almost a week!

#### 2. Share this campaign

[Find campaign here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/east-bali-coronavirus-fund)

If you‚Äôre unable to donate or want to contribute to your local community first, I completely understand - but don‚Äôt worry you can still help out!

Please share this campaign out to your entire network.

I know there are more than enough people that have fallen in love with the people here and would be more than happy to help out. We need your help getting the word out!

### WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

100% of the money will go towards our primary focus: Food & Water.

This money will be given to the [Legong Foundation](https://www.facebook.com/legongfoundation/) in Keramas to help out directly to families that need it most for food and water.

If we hit our goal we will also move towards providing...

-   Sanitation materials (soap, masks, sanitizer, etc.)
-   Direct support to individuals who have lost their jobs
-   Build a multi-family kitchen
-   Establish a clean water system to rural villages

I will be creating a publicly available spreadsheet to show exactly where every single dollar goes.

If you know the practice of Balinese Hinduism, you know karma plays a big part. If you have some spare money please consider donating, and if you can‚Äôt please give us a share. Bali will undoubtedly give back. (or maybe it‚Äôs already paid it forward ;)
