**Imagine this:** Having the freedom to work anywhere you want, exploring beautiful Australia and still earning enough money to fund your travels. You get to create your schedule and focus on exactly what you want to do.

If you're wondering how to find remote jobs in Australia, then this is the guide for you...

### The Process

There's no exact process on how to land a freelancing gig or remote job by companies, but there are a few things you can do to prepare yourself to get work quickly.

First of all, you'll need a trusted platform with professionals and companies seeking people to work for them. Once you have found this website/platform with authentic jobs and abundant listings, the next step is to sign up and build your portfolio. Create a resume that builds an impact, uploading successful projects and samples you have done in the past. It pays to have experience and an impressive history!

After you have built your profile, it's time to find a job according to your niche and what suits you. But before anything else, you must take note of the difference between both freelance and remote jobs before you choose what to apply for.

A remote job means that you are employed by companies or organizations that do not require you to be physically present in the office. With freelance jobs, you are working for a contractor without employment obligations, usually project-based and would end once you have completed the job.

Filter and apply for the jobs you are interested in, and wait until you land an interview or the job itself. Begin working and enjoy!
